        <h2>Data Visualization Dashboard</h2>
        <p>
            This project involved building an interactive data visualization dashboard using modern web technologies.
            The goal was to explore trends in large datasets and present them in a clear, accessible format.
            I focused on usability, responsive design, and clean visual hierarchy.

        <h2>Machine Learning Classification Model</h2>
        <p>
            In this project, I developed a supervised learning model to classify structured data.
            I implemented preprocessing pipelines, trained multiple models, and evaluated performance
            using cross-validation techniques. This project strengthened my understanding of feature engineering
            and model optimization.

        <p>
            This website was built using semantic HTML and CSS to demonstrate clean structure and accessibility.
            The focus was on proper page organization, reusable navigation components, and relative linking
            to ensure portability across domains.
